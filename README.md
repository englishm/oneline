oneline.rb
=======

Let's play a game!

#### There's only one rule:

- Every commit must change 1 line and only 1 line.

#### There are some suggestions, however:

- Take turns, but not necessarily in any specific order.
- Be nice.
- Don't write harmful code. (See above)
- Semicolons are probably bad form, but not prohibited.
- Have fun. Be weird. Make cool stuff.

#### And just one caution:

- Be careful. If you're not 100% sure what something does, sandbox it. Fire up vagrant or something.

You can find the _board_ in this repo as oneline.rb. (Fork it and change it to a language of your choice!)

#### NEVER ONCE ASKED QUESTIONS

*Q: I want to start a new board, what should I do?*
> A: BRANCH!

*Q: I want to play with my friends, is there a take home version?*
> A: With GitHub forking, you, too, can play with your friends.

*Q: How do I invite my friends to play?*
> A: Add them as collaborators to your fork.

#### NEVER ONCE ASSERTED ASSERTIONS

*A: I don't like your rule or any of your suggestions!*
> A: Fork it, change 'em. IDK.

*A: I don't like your caution!*
> A: You should probably leave it there if you fork. JIC.

*A: I want to protect my IP!*
> A:  Be cool, leave it public domain.
